# GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER
# Motherboard: Micro-Star B760 GAMING PLUS WIFI (MS-7D98)

### Software
# OS: Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS
# BIOS version: H.70

### Problem
# After plguin and power on the gpu, I cannot enter BIOS page anymore. Hitting "del" key during bootup will lead to a black screen.
